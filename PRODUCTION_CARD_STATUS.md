# Production Card Creation Status

## Current Situation
- **Sandbox cards**: ✓ Working perfectly
- **Production cards**: ❌ Blocked by IP restrictions

## Issue Details
- **Problem**: Strowallet API blocks production calls from "untrusted source IP"
- **Replit IPs tested**: 35.196.110.197, 35.243.197.37
- **Error message**: "This API call is from an untrusted source IP"

## Solutions Available

### Option 1: IP Whitelisting (Recommended)
Contact Strowallet support to whitelist Replit's IP addresses:
- Submit support ticket to Strowallet
- Request whitelisting of Replit IP ranges
- Once approved, production cards will work immediately

### Option 2: Alternative Deployment
- Deploy to a server with whitelisted IP
- Use VPN or proxy with trusted IP
- Run production calls from local machine

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Current)
- Use sandbox mode for testing and development
- Process production cards manually through Strowallet dashboard
- Track pending production cards in database

## Current Database Records
- Sandbox card for kalkidan: ID 7239125548 (working)

## Next Steps
1. Contact Strowallet support for IP whitelisting
2. Continue development with sandbox cards
3. Production cards will activate once IP is whitelisted
